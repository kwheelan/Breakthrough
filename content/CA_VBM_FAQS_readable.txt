
Q: Can I vote early in California?


A: In previous elections, eligible voters in some counties could vote early at select polling locations in the days leading up to Election Day. However, given that Governor Newsom ordered that every registered voter will receive a mail-in ballot for the November 3, 2020 general election, voters are encouraged to vote at home and return their ballot either by mail or at a polling place.
