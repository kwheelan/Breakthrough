				In previous elections, eligible voters in some counties could vote early at select polling locations in the days leading up to Election Day. However, given that Governor Newsom ordered that every registered voter will receive a mail-in ballot for the November 3, 2020 general election, voters are encouraged to vote at home and return their ballot either by mail or at a polling place.

2. Sign the return envelope (in the indicated box) 
1. Place completed ballot in the return envelope provided.

3. Make sure to complete all information on the outside of the return envelope. 
 
 
3. Return your ballot in time! 
1. Mail

2. Return via drop off 
1. Vote-by-mail ballots can be dropped off at any polling location in the state or at a ballot drop-off location in your county anytime from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm on Election Day (November 3, 2020).
