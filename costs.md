## Estimated Costs

### Domain
- Option 1: Buy a domain for ~$10-30/yr (GoDaddy or HostGator, etc)
    (eg. www.breakthroughvotes.org is $20.99/yr)
- Option 2: Use Breakthrough's existing domain. I don't know how the current site is hosted, but one option is to make the voting initiative a subpage of the existing site (likely at no additional domain cost). 
    (eg. https://www.breakthroughcollaborative.org/vote)
    
### Hosting
- Option 1: Host a separate **static** site on HostGator or with a similar *shared web hosting* service ($3-6/month = $36-72/yr)
- Option 2: Host the page as a subpage of the existing site (possibly no cost to host, but would require coordination with the team that build/maintains the original site)
- Option 3: Host a full-stack web application (with the ability to fetch registration and poll information) on Amazon Web Services or Heroku ($10-20/month depending on webiste traffic = $120-240/yr)

### Overall
- We need to get a domain and also host the site
- If we want interaction, it requires some backend, which is more expensive to host
-
