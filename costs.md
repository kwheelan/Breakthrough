## Estimated Costs

### Overview
- We need to get a domain and also host the site
- If we want interaction (eg. a built-in poll-finder or registration check), it requires some backend, which is more expensive to host
- **Cheapest option** $0/yr : IF:
  - We have access to the hosting details of the curent site and editing access
  - Breakthrough is willing to have the voting on the same site
  - We want a static site
- **High-end option** $260/yr for:
  - A separate domain
  - A separate hosting service 
  - A web application with interaction

### Domain
- Option 1: Buy a domain for ~$10-30/yr (GoDaddy or HostGator, etc)
    (eg. www.breakthroughvotes.org is $20.99/yr)
- Option 2: Use Breakthrough's existing domain. I don't know how the current site is hosted, but one option is to make the voting initiative a subpage of the existing site (likely at no additional domain cost). 
    (eg. https://www.breakthroughcollaborative.org/vote)
    
### Hosting
- Option 1: Host a separate **static** site on HostGator or with a similar *shared web hosting* service ($3-6/month = $36-72/yr)
- Option 2: Host the page as a subpage of the existing site (possibly no cost to host, but would require coordination with the team that build/maintains the original site)
- Option 3: Host a full-stack web application (with the ability to fetch registration and poll information) on Amazon Web Services or Heroku ($10-20/month depending on webiste traffic = $120-240/yr)
