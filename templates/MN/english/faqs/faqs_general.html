<!-- Where do I vote on Election Day on November 3, 2020? -->
<p>
<strong>Every county in Texas has their own policy about where you can vote on Election Day (November 3, 2020).</strong> <strong>However, during early voting (October 13 to October 30), you can vote at any polling location in your county.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>On Election Day on November 3, 2020, polling locations are open from 7 AM to 7 PM. If you are in line to vote at a polling location at 7 PM, you will be allowed to vote.</strong>
</p>
<p>
To find your polling location(s) for Election Day and early voting as well as early voting hours of operation, click <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://teamrv-mvp.sos.texas.gov/MVP/voterDetails.do\">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
You will be prompted to log in using one of three sets of information:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Voter Unique Identifier (VUID, found on voter registration certificate), Date of Birth

<li>Texas Driver’s License (TDL, if provided when you applied for registration), Date of Birth

<li>Name, County, Date of Birth
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you have logged in, click the link “11/03/2020 -- 2020 November 3rd General Election” under the “Upcoming Elections” tab.
</p>
<p>
You will then find your available polling locations for both the early voting period from October 13 to October 30 and your polling location(s) on Election Day. These locations may differ between Election Day and early voting locations.
</p>
",

"<!-- What identification do I need to provide to vote? -->
<p>
When you arrive at a polling location, you will be asked to present one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID (listed below). If you do not possess an acceptable form of photo identification and cannot reasonably obtain one, you may present a supporting form of ID and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration.
</p>
<p>
However, if you have an acceptable form of photo ID, but, you forget to bring it to the polling place, you may either leave and return before the close of the polls with your ID or cast a provisional ballot. In order for a provisional ballot to be counted, you must visit your County Voter Registrar’s office within six calendar days of Election Day to either present an acceptable form of photo ID or follow the Reasonable Impediment Declaration procedure. Visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/need-id.html\">this</a> link for more information on required identification, including religious objection, natural disasters, and disability exemptions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Remember to bring ONE of the seven following ID with you to your polling location:</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Texas Driver License issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)

<li>Texas Election Identification Certificate issued by DPS

<li>Texas Personal Identification Card issued by DPS

<li>Texas Handgun License issued by DPS

<li>United States Military Identification Card containing your photograph

<li>United States Citizenship Certificate containing your photograph

<li>United States Passport (book or card)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>With the exception of the U.S. Citizenship Certificate, which does not expire, for voters aged 18-69, your acceptable form of photo identification cannot be more than 4 years expired.</strong> For voters aged 70 or older, your acceptable form of photo identification may be expired for any length of time if the identification is otherwise valid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you do not possess an acceptable form of photo identification, and cannot reasonably obtain one, bring one of the following supporting forms of ID to the polls. </strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Copy or original of a government document that shows your name and an address. <strong>This includes your voter registration certificate</strong>

<li>Copy of or original current utility bill

<li>Copy of or original bank statement

<li>Copy of or original government check

<li>Copy of or original paycheck

<li>Copy of or original of (a) a certified domestic (from a U.S. state or territory) birth certificate or (b) a document confirming birth admissible in a court of law which establishes the voter’s identity (which may include a foreign birth document).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you use an above supporting ID to vote at your polling location, you must fill out a Reasonable Impediment Declaration at the polling location.
</p>",

"<!-- My name on my identification (acceptable ID, or supporting ID, if applicable) does not exactly match my name on my voter registration card. Can I still vote? -->
<p>
Election officials will review your ID (acceptable form of photo ID, or supporting form of ID, if applicable) and if your name on your ID is “substantially similar” to your name on their list of registered voters, you will still be able to vote. You will also have to submit an affidavit stating that you are the same person on the list of registered voters.
</p>",

"<!-- Does the address on my ID have to match my address on my voter registration to be an acceptable ID? -->
<p>
<strong>No, there is no address matching requirement. </strong>The address on your ID (acceptable form of photo ID, or supporting form of ID, if applicable) does not have to match your address on the official list of registered voters when you vote at your polling location.
</p>",

"<!-- Can I vote early in Texas? Where? -->
<p>
<strong>Any registered voter in Texas can vote during the early voting period from October 13, 2020 - October 30, 2020. </strong>
</p>
<p>
During early voting, registered voters can vote at any polling location in their county. To find your polling locations and hours of operation, click <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://teamrv-mvp.sos.texas.gov/MVP/mvp.do\">here</a>.
</p>",

"<!-- I forgot or do not have a proper ID to vote. Can I still cast a ballot? -->
<p>
Yes, depending on the circumstance. See the question “<em>What identification do I need to provide to vote?” </em>for more information.
</p>",

"<!-- Can I get time off from work to vote? -->
<p>
Yes. If you do not vote during the early voting period (October 13, 2020 - October 30, 2020),  you may be eligible to take time off during the work day on Election Day (November 3, 2020).
</p>
<p>
All workers, including temporary and seasonal workers, are protected by the following laws.
</p>
<ul>

<li>Employers must give employees at least two hours off from work to vote if the employee does not otherwise have two consecutive hours to vote outside of their working hours while polls are open.

<li>Employers must allow employees to take the time off to vote without threats, intimidation or any other penalty.

<li>Employers cannot reduce or threaten to reduce an employee’s wages or other benefits for voting for or against a particular candidate or refusing to disclose how they voted.
</li>

</p>
<p>
<strong>You may only vote using a “limited” ballot once you’ve moved to your new address and only during the early voting period (October 13, 2020 - October 30, 2020).

<strong>The following must also be true to cast a “limited” ballot:</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li>You would be eligible to vote in your former county of residence on Election Day, if you were still living in that county

<li>You have not re-registered in your county, OR, if you have re-registered, the effective date of the new registration will not be effective on or before Election Day.
</li>
</ul>
