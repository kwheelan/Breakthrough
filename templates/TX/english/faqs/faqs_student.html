<li><strong>Register</strong>
<p>
If you are a college student living away from home, you first need to decide where “home” is. If your parents’ or other family members’ place of residence is what you consider “home,” use that address to register. If your campus address is what you consider “home,” use that address to register. You can only register in one place.
If you consider yourself a resident of another state, check your
<a target= \"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usa.gov/election-office\">state’s election information website</a> to learn about voting in that state.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Voting away from home</strong>
<p>
If you are claiming your parents’ or family members’ place of residence as “home,” and will not be there during the early voting period/on Election Day, you can request to vote with a mail-in ballot with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/forms/5-15f.pdf\">this application</a>. For more information about voting by mail, go <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.votetexas.gov/voting/when.html#helpful-hints-on-voting-early-by-mail\">here</a>.
