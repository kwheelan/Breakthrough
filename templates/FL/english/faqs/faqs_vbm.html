  Anyone in Florida can request to vote by mail.
</strong>
Voters who do not want to vote at a polling place in the November 3, 2020 general election may elect to vote by mail to avoid COVID-19 exposure.
<br><br>
A request to vote by mail may be made in one of the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>Online application on your
    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/\" target=\"_blank\">county Supervisors of Elections’</a> website
  </li>
  <li>
    By other writing (i.e. by email, fax, mail) to your Supervisor of Elections
  </li>
  <li>
    In person at the office of you Supervisor of Elections
  </li>
  <li>
    By telephone call to your Supervisor of Elections
  </li>
</ul>

To make a request, the following information is required:
<ul>
  <li>The name of the voter for whom the ballot is being requested</li>
  <li>The voter’s address</li>
  <li>The voter’s date of birth</li>
  <li>The voter’s signature (if the request is written and the request is to an address other than on one’s voter file)</li>
</ul>

If an immediate family member or legal guardian is requesting a vote-by-mail ballot as directed by the voter, the following additional information must be provided:
<ul>
  <li>
    The requestor’s address
  </li>
  <li>The requestor’s driver’s license number (if available)</li>
  <li>The requestor’s relationship to the voter</li>
  <li>The requestor’s signature (if the request is written)</li>
</ul>
<strong>A request for a vote-by-mail ballot must be mailed no later than 5pm on October 24, 2020. </strong>",

"Your county Supervisor of Elections must mail your requested ballot within 2 business days after your request for a vote-by-mail is received.
The last day for a Supervisor to be able to mail out a ballot is 8 days before the election (October 26, 2020).
<br><br>
<strong>
  To guarantee that you receive your vote-by-mail ballot for the general election on November 3, submit a request to your county Supervisor of Elections as soon as possible.
</strong>
<br><br>
In previous elections, voters in some counties had the option to pick up their blank vote-by-mail ballot in person. Due to Covid-19 it is unclear if this option will be available for the general election on November 3, 2020.
