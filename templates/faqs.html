        Although not ideal, if you miss the October 19, 2020 registration deadline
        to register or update your voter registration, don’t worry!
        Eligible voters in California (see above) can complete the registration
        process and vote at their local county elections office, polling place,
        or vote center within 14 days of the election. These ballots will be counted
        once the state verifies the voter registration of these voters. Go

        In most cases, voters in California don’t need to show a form of identification to a poll worker before voting.
        However, if you are voting for the first time after registering to vote by mail and did
        not provide your driver license number, California identification number or the last four digits of
        your social security number on your registration form, you may be asked to show a form of
        identification when you go to the polls. Be sure to bring identification with you to your
        polling place or include a copy of it with your vote-by-mail ballot. <br><br>
        <strong>Please bring one of the following as a form of ID:</strong>

        Yes, California law requires employers to provide time for employees to vote.
        Every voter is entitled to 2 hours to vote at the beginning or end of their shift depending on which
        gives the employee most time to vote and takes least time off work. This time is paid up to 2 hours.
        The employee must give the employer at least 2 working days notice in advance of the election.
        The California Elections Code also requires employers to post a notice no less than 10 days
        before every statewide election explaining employees' right to time off to vote. The notice
        must be posted in a conspicuous place at the work site. See more
