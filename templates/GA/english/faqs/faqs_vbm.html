<strong>Any registered voter is eligible to vote by mail with an absentee ballot in Georgia.</strong> Voting by mail means you can vote from the comfort of your home.

<p>
Absentee ballots will be mailed to voters who requested to vote by mail beginning<strong> 45 days prior to November 3, 2020 through Friday, October 30, 2020.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Under State law, ballots cannot be mailed to you on Monday, November 2, 2020, the day prior to Election Day. <strong>Please note that you should make your request early to allow time for your ballot to be mailed to you, voted, and be received back at the county registrar office before the close of polls on Election Day, November 3, 2020.</strong>

<p>
<em>Q. How do I vote with my absentee ballot?</em>
</p>
<p>
Follow the instructions that your county elections official provides with your ballot. You will receive all the forms and envelopes necessary for marking and return of the ballot. If you fail to complete your ballot correctly your ballot may not be counted.
</p>
<p>
If you registered by mail and did not submit a copy of one of the required forms of registration identification, you will receive notification with your ballot package. Copies of any IDs must be placed in the outer envelope. If you have any questions, please contact your <a target = \"_blank\" href=\"https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/countyregistrars.do\">county registrar</a>.

"<!-- I received a vote-by-mail ballot, but I want to vote at the polls in person. What should I do? -->
<p>
If you voted with your absentee ballot and it was returned to and received by the board of registrars, then you will have cast your vote. You will not be able to vote at the polls in person.
</p>
<p>
If you still have your absentee ballot and give it to the poll manager of the precinct in which your name appears on the electors list, then you will be able to vote with a regular ballot.
</p>
<p>
If you have not received an absentee ballot, or if you have returned the absentee ballot, but the registrars have not received the ballot, you may cancel your absentee ballot by appearing in person before the registrar or absentee ballot clerk and making a written request to have the ballot marked “cancelled.” After confirming your identity, the registrars or absentee ballot clerk will notify the managers of your precinct to allow you to vote in person at that precinct.
