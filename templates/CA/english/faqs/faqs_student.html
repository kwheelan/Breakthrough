<p>
If you are a college student living away from home, you first need to decide where “home” is. If your parents’ or other family members’ place of residence is what you consider “home,” use that address to register.
</p>
<p>
If your campus address is what you consider “home,” use that address to register.  However, you can only register in one place. If you consider yourself a resident of another state, contact their election’s division about how to vote in that state.
